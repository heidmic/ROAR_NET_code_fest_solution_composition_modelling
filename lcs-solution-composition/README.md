## Introduction

Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs) are a type of evolutionary machine learning 
algorithm that constructs solutions to the learning task as a finite set of 
rules each approximating a share of the input space. Some LCSs separate the 
discovery of rules from the final composition of the model returned by the 
training process, e.g. SupRB https://doi.org/10.1145/3520304.3529014 or 
HEROS https://doi.org/10.1145/3712256.3726461. 

This problem statement describes the combinatorial optimization problem that
both systems have to solve to provide an accurate yet compact solution.

## Task

Given a set of rules, select a minimal subset that can still make good 
predictions.

## Detailed description

Provide a detailed description of the problem in this section. This should
detail what parameters characterise a problem instance, what characterises a
solution, how a solution is evaluated (e.g. an objective function), and solution
feasibility constraints.

## Instance data file

Describe the format of a problem instance file.

## Solution file

Describe the format of a solution file.

## Example

### Instance

Provide a small example instance in the described format.

### Solution

Provide a feasible solution to the example instance in the described format
(including its evaluation measure).

### Explanation

Optionally, provide a descriptive and/or visual explanation of the solution (and
its evaluation measure value) for the instance.
